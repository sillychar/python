Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms 
that can improve automatically 
through experience and by the use of data. 
It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, 
processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, 
structured and unstructured data,[1][2] and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data 
across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine 
learning and big data.
